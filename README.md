# GUI Practice

## Due: Fri 4/26 at 11:59 PM

- Create a program called `GuiPractice.java`
- You will make a GUI that displays different pictures one at a time
  - The image files are provided for you in the `images/` directory
- Include a combo box for the user to select which picture to display
- Include one label that contains an image
- Use ItemListener instead of ActionListener
- When the selection for the combo box changes, the picture should change
  - Make sure the size of the picture does not change
  - Also print what picture was deselected and what picture was selected
- When you are done, uncomment the print statement in `Done.java`

***Example output:***\
Ball selected\
Ball deselected\
Card selected\
Card deselected\
Shoe selected\
